# Wiki Shorts

A project built for the HackGTeeny GITMAD workshop mini-hackathon, Wiki Shorts reimagines educational content consumption in today's short-form content era.

## Project Overview

In a world where platforms like YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels capture hours of users' attention with entertainment content, Wiki Shorts aims to make that time more productive. This Android app transforms Wikipedia articles into bite-sized, swipeable cards â€“ similar to the addictive format of social media shorts, but with educational content.

## Why Wiki Shorts?

- **Problem**: People spend countless hours scrolling through short-form videos, often with minimal educational value
- **Solution**: Wiki Shorts provides the same engaging, swipeable interface but delivers knowledge and learning instead
- **Goal**: Make learning as addictive as social media scrolling
