            summary = "Deep ocean ecosystems, existing below 200 meters, represent some of Earth's most mysterious and unexplored environments. These dark waters host an incredible array of life forms adapted to extreme pressure, cold temperatures, and complete darkness. Bioluminescent organisms create their own light, while hydrothermal vents support unique chemosynthetic communities. Scientists continue to discover new species in these depths, highlighting how much remains unknown about our ocean's deepest regions. Recent expeditions have revealed complex food webs and ecological relationships that challenge our understanding of life itself.",
